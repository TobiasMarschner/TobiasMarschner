## Tobias Marschner's GitHub Profile

Hey there! I'm a computer scientist from Hamburg, Germany currently finishing my master's degree at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://tuhh.de/).

Over at [tobiasm.dev](https://tobiasm.dev) I maintain my [personal blog](https://tobiasm.dev/articles/) and [project showcase](https://tobiasm.dev/projects/).
Source code for my personal projects is **not hosted on GitHub** but instead maintained on my own [self-hosted Gitea instance](https://git.tobiasm.dev/tobiasm).
