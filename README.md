Hey there! I'm a computer scientist from Hamburg, Germany currently finishing my master's degree at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://tuhh.de/).
Over at [tobiasm.dev](https://tobiasm.dev) I maintain my [personal blog](https://tobiasm.dev/articles/) and [project showcase](https://tobiasm.dev/projects/).

Not all of my projects are hosted on GitHub. More personal works are instead maintained on my [self-hosted Gitea instance](https://git.tobiasm.dev/tobiasm).

### Featured Project: [FerriShare](https://github.com/TobiasMarschner/ferrishare)

FerriShare is a simple, self-hostable filesharing application with builtin end-to-end encryption, written in Rust.
Check out the [repository](https://github.com/TobiasMarschner/ferrishare) for all the details, or [jump straight into the demo](https://ferrishare-demo.tobiasm.dev).
